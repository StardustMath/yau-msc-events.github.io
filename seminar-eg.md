### Enumerative invariants of 3-fold flops: hyperplane arrangements and wall-crossing

3-fold flopping contractions form a fundamental building block of the higher-dimensional Minimal Model Program. They exhibit extremely rich geometry, which has been investigated by many people over the past half-century. I will present an elegant and visually-pleasing relationship between enumerative invariants of flopping contractions and certain hyperplane arrangements constructed combinatorially from root system data. I will discuss both Gopakumar-Vafa (GV) and Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants, explaining how these are related to one another and how they are encoded in finite and infinite arrangements, respectively. Finally, I will discuss wall-crossing: our combinatorial approach allows us to explicitly construct flops from root system data, leading to a new “direct” proof of the Crepant Transformation Conjecture, with a very explicit formulation. This is joint work with Michael Wemyss.

### About the paper "Motivic degree zero Donaldson-Thomas invariants" by Kai Behrend, Jim Bryan, Balázs Szendröi

This talk is about the paper "Motivic degree zero Donaldson-Thomas invariants" by Kai Behrend, Jim Bryan, Balázs Szendröi. [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.5088)/[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00222-012-0408-1)

I will talk about definition of motivic weights, definition of motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants and sketch of calculation of virtual motive of Hilbert scheme of points.
